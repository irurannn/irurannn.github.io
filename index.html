   <h1>JOIN THE NIGHT'S WATCH! </h1>

<br>

<p> After the Long Night, the King of Winter Brandon the Builder, founder of House Stark, built the wall to protect the realm from the Others with help from the Children of the Forest. Now, the wall is under threat from Mance Raydar's wildlings, a turncloak who seeks to pillage our villages, steal our children, and rape our wives. It is time to take a stand against these bastards, and protect Westeros. We are the shields that guard the realms of men! </p>
<br>


<h3><i> <strong>And Winter is coming.</strong></i></h3>

<br>


<p>Here, a man gets what he earns. Legends have risen from the slums of Moletown, the bogs of the river lands, and the sewers of Casterly Rock to become leaders. Here are legendary nobles that fought for and defended their black brothers as Lord Commanders</p>
<ul><b>

<li> Brynden Rivers, Hand to King Aerys the First</li>
<li> Osric Stark, the youngest elected Lord Commander</li>
<li> Jeor Mormont, who defended the Night's Watch at the Fist of the First Men</li>
</ul>
</b>


<p>When a brother says his vows and takes the black, he is bound for life...</p>

<p><em><b>Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men.</b></em></p>

<p class= "vows"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsVBo-Gq110/">I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.</a></p>
